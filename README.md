# es-java-client
client code for older version of ES

As i have frequently the need to communicate with 5.6 version of ES server, I keep repeating the same code to communicate and send my rest api requests there. So this is a library which will simplify my calls for it. It's not planned as an implementation of regular high-level ES client code, rather an intermediary - to simplify sending REST requests, scrolling through responses and handling response codes.
